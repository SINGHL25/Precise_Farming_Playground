## 🌾 Problem Statement

Modern agriculture faces unprecedented challenges:
- **Global food security**: Need to feed 9.7 billion people by 2050
- **Resource constraints**: Limited arable land, water scarcity, soil degradation
- **Climate change**: Unpredictable weather patterns, extreme events
- **Economic pressures**: Rising input costs, volatile market prices
- **Environmental impact**: Need for sustainable farming practices
- **Knowledge gaps**: Limited access to scientific farming methods

Traditional farming relies heavily on experience and intuition, often leading to:
- Suboptimal crop selection for soil conditions
- Over/under-application of fertilizers and water
- Reactive rather than preventive pest management
- Economic losses due to poor planning
- Environmental degradation from unsustainable practices
